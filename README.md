## Welcome to Library

This is a simple project created in JAVA to practice language skills a little. In this project, you can donate, borrow, or return a book.

### Preamble 

- There is no graphical interface for user interaction; therefore, all communication is done through the terminal!
- To access the project, you need to have Java installed.
- Run the Main() class to test all project features.
- The init of the library system counts with one user, three books and authors. You can change this configuration in the Main() class to tests some exceptions.
