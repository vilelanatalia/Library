## Welcome to Library

This is a simple project created in JAVA to practice language skills a little. In this project, you can donate, borrow, or return a book.

### Preamble 

- There is no graphical interface for user interaction; therefore, all communication is done through the terminal!
- To access the project, you need to have Java installed.
